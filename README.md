# Faking1340

Here's a suggested structure for the C++ implementation of your text-based game:

main.cpp
fix.h
fix.cpp
generate_key.h
generate_key.cpp
rps.h
rps.cpp
sudoku.h
sudoku.cpp
tile.h
tile.cpp
tntman.h
tntman.cpp
encryption.h
encryption.cpp
filekey.key
ranking.txt
mazes.h
Now let's go through each file and see what they should contain:

main.cpp: This file will contain the main function and logic of your game, adapted from your Python main.py file. You will need to include necessary headers and use C++ syntax and libraries (like <iostream>, <fstream>, <chrono>, <thread>, and <vector>). Replace print statements with cout, handle user input using cin, and use C++ data types like std::string, std::vector, and std::ifstream.

fix.h: Declare functions related to fixing encryption, if needed in your C++ implementation.

fix.cpp: Implement the functions declared in fix.h.

generate_key.h: Declare functions for key generation.

generate_key.cpp: Implement key generation functions declared in generate_key.h.

rps.h: Declare the Rock-Paper-Scissors game class and its member functions.

rps.cpp: Implement the Rock-Paper-Scissors game class.

sudoku.h: Declare the Sudoku game class and its member functions.

sudoku.cpp: Implement the Sudoku game class.

tile.h: Declare the Tile game class and its member functions.

tile.cpp: Implement the Tile game class.

tntman.h: Declare the Tntman game class and its member functions.

tntman.cpp: Implement the Tntman game class.

encryption.h: Declare functions for encryption and decryption of files.

encryption.cpp: Implement the encryption and decryption functions using a C++ cryptography library, such as Crypto++.

filekey.key: The same key file used in your Python implementation.

ranking.txt: The same ranking file used in your Python implementation.

mazes.h: Store the mazes as std::vector<std::string> or std::vector<std::vector<char>> in this header file.

Make sure to replace Python-specific functions with C++ equivalents, and use C++ standard libraries to handle file I/O, strings, and other data structures.
